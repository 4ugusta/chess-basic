              Chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a checkered
              gameboard with 64 squares arranged in an 8Ã—8 grid. The game is
              played by millions of people worldwide. Chess is believed to be
              derived from the Indian game chaturanga sometime before the 7th
              century. Chaturanga is also the likely ancestor of the Eastern
              strategy games xiangqi, janggi, and shogi. Chess reached Europe by
              the 9th century, due to the Umayyad conquest of Hispania. The
              pieces assumed their current powers in Spain in the late 15th
              century; the rules were finally standardized in the 19th century.
